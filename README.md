Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: Will merging images with Merge JPG reduce quality? A: JPEG is a lossy format by nature. To get the best results, it's recommended to select "High" in the "Quality" option. As long as your original images are clear, the merged image will also be very high quality.

Q: What's the maximum number of images I can merge at once? A: Merge JPG currently supports merging up to 20 images at a time, which is sufficient for most everyday needs.
